# Mind Map AI - Next Steps

This document outlines the next steps for the Mind Map AI project, based on what has been accomplished so far.

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Project Setup and Structure**

   - Initialized React project with TypeScript
   - Set up project structure and component organization
   - Created basic layout with panels (Left, Right, Bottom, Canvas)
   - Implemented theme switching (dark/light mode)
   - Set up state management with Zustand
   - Created basic types and interfaces

2. **UI Components**

   - Implemented Left Panel with shape categories and previews
   - Created Bottom Panel for properties editing
   - Developed Right Panel for AI assistant
   - Added basic styling and theme support
   - Implemented Shape Library with search and filtering
   - Created drag and drop functionality from shape library to canvas

3. **AI Integration**

   - Set up OpenAI API connection
   - Created service layer for AI requests
   - Implemented API key validation
   - Added error handling and loading states
   - Created conversation interface for the AI assistant

4. **State Management**
   - Implemented Zustand store for diagram data
   - Created custom hooks for diagram operations
   - Set up theme state management

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Canvas Implementation (Priority: High)**

   - Integrate React Flow or Konva for the canvas
   - Implement basic node and edge rendering
   - Create drag and drop functionality from the shape library
   - Implement canvas navigation (pan, zoom)
   - Add selection and multi-selection of elements

2. **Connect UI Components to State (Priority: High)**

   - Connect property panel to selected elements
   - Implement property changes with live preview
   - Connect AI-generated diagrams to the canvas

3. **AI Functionality (Priority: Medium)**

   - Implement text-to-diagram conversion
   - Create parsing logic for different diagram types
   - Add diagram-to-code generation

4. **Testing and Debugging (Priority: Medium)**
   - Test OpenAI integration with different prompts
   - Debug any issues with the UI components
   - Ensure theme switching works correctly
   - Test drag and drop functionality with different shapes

## How to Proceed

1. **Canvas Implementation**

   - Research React Flow and Konva to decide which library to use
   - Start with a simple implementation of nodes and edges
   - Implement basic drag and drop functionality
   - Add zoom and pan controls
   - Implement selection and manipulation of shapes

2. **Connect UI to State**

   - Update the Bottom Panel to display properties of selected elements
   - Implement property editing functionality
   - Connect the AI-generated diagrams to the canvas

3. **AI Functionality**
   - Implement the text-to-diagram conversion
   - Create a parser for the OpenAI response
   - Add diagram-to-code generation

## Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Canvas Implementation
- **Week 3**: Connect UI Components to State
- **Week 4-5**: AI Functionality
- **Week 6**: Testing and Debugging

## Conclusion

We've made significant progress on the Mind Map AI project, setting up the basic structure and implementing key components. We've successfully implemented the shape library with drag and drop functionality to the canvas. The next steps focus on enhancing the canvas functionality with a proper diagram library (React Flow or Konva) and connecting the UI components to the state, which will bring the application closer to a functional prototype.
